''' What is python?
Python is a high-level,  interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
It is widely used in various fields like web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and more.

Imagine Python as a magic tool 🪄 that allows you to talk to a computer using simple English-like commands
 instead of complex codes.

Here’s how you can break it down:

Easy to Learn & Read 📖

Python code looks almost like regular English.
Example: Instead of writing complex code, you can just say:
print("Hello, World!")
This will simply print "Hello, World!" on the screen.


Great for Beginners & Professionals 🏆
Whether you're new to coding or an expert, Python is beginner-friendly and powerful.


Multi-Purpose Language 🔧
Used in Websites (Django, Flask) 🌐
Used in AI & Machine Learning 🤖
Used in Data Science & Automation 📊

Short & clean syntax ✅
Requires fewer lines of code ✅
Large community & support ✅'''

'''An interpreted language is a type of programming language where the code is executed line by line by an interpreter, 
rather than being compiled all at once into machine code.

🔹 Key Features of Interpreted Languages:

Executed Line by Line 📝

The interpreter reads one line at a time and runs it immediately.
Example:'''
print("Hello, World!")  # This line runs instantly

'''No Need for Compilation Before Running 🚀:
Unlike compiled languages (e.g., C, C++), Python doesn’t require a separate compilation step.
You write & run the code directly.

Slower than Compiled Languages 🐢:
Since the interpreter runs the code line by line, it might be slower than compiled languages like C/C++ that convert 
everything to machine code first.

Easy Debugging & Development 🛠️:
Since errors show up immediately while running the code, debugging is easier compared to compiled languages.

🔹 Examples of Interpreted Languages:
Python 🐍
JavaScript 🖥️
Ruby 💎
PHP 🌐'''
'''🔹 Key Differences:
Feature:                          Python(Interpreted)	               C (Compiled)
Execution:                        Line-by-line	                       Entire program at once
Speed:                            Slower	                           Faster
Compilation Required?:	          ❌ No	                              ✅ Yes
Ease of Debugging:                Easier	                           Harder (must recompile after changes)''' '''
